# TIME FOR TEST :

-   So, basically there are 3 types of testting that developer can do :

    -   _Unit Testing_ :

        -   _What it is_: Testing small parts, like individual components, in your React app separately.
        -   _Example_: Testing a button or a form field to make sure it works on its own.
        -   _Why it's important_: Helps catch bugs early and ensures each piece of your app works correctly.

    -   _Integration testing_ :

        -   _What it is_: Testing how different parts of your app work together. So this type of testing is known as integration testing where multiple components involves and talking to each other.
        -   _Example_: Checking if a form submission updates a list correctly or if a button click triggers the right action.
        -   _Why it's important_: Ensures that different components can communicate and function correctly as a whole.

    -   _End to End Testing (e2e testing)_ :
        -   _What it is_: Testing your entire app from start to finish, just like a real user would. That means testing the react application as soon as the user lands on the website to the user leaves the website it will test all the floors.
        -   _Example_: Automating actions like signing in, navigating through pages, and submitting forms.
        -   _Why it's important_: Validates the overall functionality and flow of your app, ensuring a smooth user experience.

-   So, _unit testing_ checks individual parts, _integration testing_ checks how they work together, and _end-to-end testing_ checks the whole app like a real user. Each type serves a specific purpose in ensuring your React app functions correctly.
