# NAMASTE-REACT COURSE EPISODE-1 ðŸš€

REACT INTRODUCTION :-

1. React is a free and open-source JavaScript library for building interactive websites and user interfaces or front-end webpage components
   such as forms along with fields like text areas and buttons.
2. Since its release in 2013, React has been maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) along with a community of developers and companies.
3. It is component-based. An example of a component could be a form or even just a form field or button on a website.
4. In React, applications are completely built with components.
5. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications. React allows us to create reusable UI components.
6. ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library created by Facebook's Jordan Walke to make user interfaces for both web and mobile systems.
7. React was first used in 2011 on Facebook's newsfeed. In 2012, it was used on Instagram, and in 2013 it was made available to the public.
8. React is best for applications that change their data quickly and dynamically. It can show the parts of the UI that are changing without
   re-rendering the whole page. This makes the user experience much faster.

HOW DOES REACT WORK :-

1. While building client-side apps, a team of Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model
   (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.)
2. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
3. So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript.
4. When a user interacts with react application, React updates the virtual DOM and then compares the vitual DOM with the actual DOM.
   It makes the necessary changes to the actual DOM which are reflected in the UI.
5. The virtual DOM is a lightweight tree that contains only the necessary information to render a UI.
6. The virtual DOM is the javascript object that is made up of react elements.

WHAT IS EMMET ?

It is designed to speed up the process of writing and editing the code by providing a set of shortcuts that can be quickly expandable to full code blocks.

WHAT IS CDN ?

1. Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of services that delivers the content to users.
2. Both React and React DOM are available over CDN.
3. So, Basically it speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
4. The primary purpose of CDN is to reduce the delay in communication created by a network's design.

CROSSORIGIN ATTRIBUTE IN CDN LINKS :

1. Crossorigin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an http header based mechanism that allows a serverv to indicate any crossorigin (domain or port)
   other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
2. Crossorigin attribute provides support for CORS.
3. <script crossorigin src = "....."></script> This indiactes that the script should be loaded from a diff. origin.

WHY REACT IS KNOWN AS 'REACT' ?

Beacuse it was designed to help developers "react" to changes in the state of an application by efficiently rendering and uploading
the UI in response to those changes.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRAMEWORK AND LIBRARY :

1. A framework is used for building and deploying an application quickly.
2. When we use a framework, we can use resources to facilitate faster development and a greater user experience.

3. A library is used to enhance the functionality of an application.
4. Libraries provide developers predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development process.
